# Portfolio

WIP version of my one-page portfolio.
The aim is only to showcase some designs and have a small space to tell what I did and what I want.

I'll implement a Masonry.js layout for the projects, and will turn the architecture in an angular.js based portfolio so I can add project templates and case studies templates, inspired by the wonderful http://haraldurthorleifsson.com/

The point of this portfolio is not about SEO, I'd rather have it noindex.You have Dribbble to showcase some things. Put the things you can't show (ongoing projects, NDA stuffs etc) on your personal portfolio and keep if noindex and/or locked.
